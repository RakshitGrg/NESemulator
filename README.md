# NES Emualator
## A Nintendo Entertainment system

This project aims at implementing the NES by developing an emulator to mimic it's features and create our own persoalised video-games similar to Mario, Donkey Kong and many others.
The 6502 Microprocesor is the main chip driving the whole system and which was widely used in the past for the same purpose.
